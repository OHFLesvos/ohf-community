Operating this service requires that we collect certain personal information. This information is not shared with any third parties, except if forced by law or stated explicitly in this document.

To identify you as a legitimate user, we store:

* your e-mail address
* your name
* a cryptographically hashed form of your password

User preferences (e.g. your language) and any information you add to your profile is also stored in our database.

For auditing purposes, we collect with every request to this web application:

* the IP address of your device or network
* the date and time
* the URL of the requested site
* the browser/client application used

This application uses cookies to improve user experience (e.g. to remember your login). 

User account-related activities (e.g. login, password or name change) will be logged for auditing purposes. Audit log files may be kept for a duration of up to one year.

You may terminate your account at any time, which will remove your personal data from the database as soon as possible.

Regular backups of our database will be created and stored for one week, in case we have to restore the application after an outage.

This service runs on a technical platform of a trusted web hosting service, which adheres to strict privacy laws, and will not share any data with third parties (except if forced by law).
